Smartphone-based navigation applications (apps) such as Google Maps, Waze, and Apple Maps have immense influence on our day-to-day trip decisions. May it be choosing the nearest restaurant from our apartment on a Friday evening or the shortest route to our workplace on weekdays, we all end up using these apps on a daily basis.
 
Even though several alternatives to these smartphone apps exist, including offline GPS-based navigation devices and radio traffic updates, the apps are much more popular as smartphones have been integrated heavily into our daily life. Moreover, smartphone apps are updated frequently, so new features that aid ease of navigation come up at zero cost to us. Remember Google Maps adding the speed limit feature some months ago? Inexpensive, accessible, and effective - there seems to be no reason not to use them.
 
While smartphone-based navigation has become universal, studies have pointed out that these apps have some drawbacks as well. As we are used to depend on the apps for directions, we gradually lose our natural navigation ability. The consequence? We are in trouble when the apps fail to function as expected. We end up driving around aimlessly waiting for the app to work again while focusing our attention on figuring out why the app is not working. Such collective behaviors can potentially cause adverse effects in the traffic network.
 
These incidents happen more frequently in the cities and could be triggered by a wide range of causal events â€“ jamming, insufficient network coverage, technical glitches at the operator-end, or the worst, a communications blackout.
 
Thus, in this survey, we seek to understand how various drivers react to route choice uncertainties arising from functional disruptions of such in-vehicle real-time navigation systems. The survey also explores the potential trip-related decisions made by drivers during the span of the disruption.

Again, thank you very much for participating in this survey.


## Network Modeling
There are several projects within this field that I conducted:
1  Agent-based Modeling: Simulating Downtown Austin Network using Anylogic
This project is still in progress, but the goal is to estimate the effect of disruptions to the transportation network caused by failures of real-time navigation and the GPS.

Network Scope

2  Python Programing: Measuring the Effects of Operating Navigation Apps on the Network
This project uses Python to simulate a network with drivers with access to real-time data before their trips (at time t0), during their trips (at time t1), and with no access.

Case Study

Results from running the simulations:
1. More people with real-time data access will increase flow efficiency (decrease average travel time in the whole system).
2. No difference between accessing the data before or during the trips.
